    I am a learning to become a front end web developer! After a year of looking into coding classes and self training apps, I am in the process of completing and graduating the 10 week FEWD cource at 
    <a href="http://ga.co">General Assembly</a> of Seattle.

  <p>
    My first website homework project proved to be quite the challenge and it took me 54 minutes to correctly position my image to the right-side of the web page. Accomplishing these smalls feats (to some) has been the equivelent of climbig Everest, to me. I am eager to know every part of FEWD but I have been humbled by the complexity of it and understand that this is a new language that I am learning, this will take <b>dedication</b>, <b>practice</b>, and <b>time</b>.
